# In this programm we will look at type casting

a = "15"
b = "Bhanu"
print(a+b) # This will do string concatination
print(type(a))
a = int(a)
# print(a+b) # This line will throw an error since it is adding string with number
print(type(a))
# b = int(b) #This whll throw an error since b does not contain number
